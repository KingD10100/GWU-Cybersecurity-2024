Overview Project 1
This week, you will use Microsoft Azure to build and host your own web application, secure it with an SSL certificate, and add security features to protect it. 
This week will incorporate topics from previous modules including: networking, network security, cryptography, terminal, cloud, and web development. Today, you will build and host your web application.

Overview Project 2: CTF activity
In today's class you will continue to exploit Rekall's technical infrastructure, but today you'll focus on Rekall's Windows servers and vulnerabilities related to Windows operating systems. 
You will continue finding flags during your exploitation.

Overview Project 3: Building a Security Monitoring Environment
Today, you will work with your group to develop a defensive solution in order to protect the mock organization. You will receive logs of “normal” business functions in order to understand the organization's environment. You will use these logs to create baselines and then design custom alerts, reports, and dashboards. You will additionally have the opportunity to download and use a Splunk "add-on" app of your choice to monitor against a type of attack.

Overview Project 4: Bootcon
This project highlights the vulnerabilities within WordPress platforms, which power over 40% of websites globally. By demonstrating a controlled exploit, we aim to showcase common security gaps such as outdated plugins or weak credentials. The project will utilize tools ie. WPScan for identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities. Our group will divide responsibilities: one member will focus on vulnerability research, two will manage exploit execution, and the remaining two will handle documentation and preparing a mitigation strategy.
